# iocto_tonemap_compose
My Tonemap and Compose implementations for the Yocto library (https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl).

This is my own implementation (C++) for Tonemap and Compose functions on a old version of the Yocto library (by Prof. F. Pellacini) made for a homework in the Computer Graphics course of Prof. F. Pellacini (University of Rome "La Sapienza").
